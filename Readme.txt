## THE PROJECT

The project explores the walmart data set of 45 stores which cover a period of 2010/02/05 to 2012/10/26
it analyses the totals sales made my Walmart for the period in review and the impact of holidays on sales during the weeks with holidays. It also analyses the effect of umemployment rate on sales.

### COLUMNS

- Store - the store number
- Date - the week of sales
- Weekly_Sales - sales for the given store
- Holiday_Flag - whether the week is a special holiday week 1 – Holiday week 0 – Non-holiday week
- Temperature - Temperature on the day of sale
- Fuel_Price - Cost of fuel in the region
- CPI – Prevailing consumer price index
- Unemployment - Prevailing unemployment rate


## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

- The total sales for the period under review is $6,737,218,987.11
- The average weekly sales is $1,046,964.88
- Store 20 has the highest total sales for the period in review while store 33 has the lowest total sales
- We noticed that there is a higher average sales in the weeks with holidays as against the week without holidays and this can be attributed to more shopping for the holiday seasons or more incentives given to customers to increase their purchase(We do not have comprehensive data to justify and this is just inferential at this point)
- There is a 7.84% change in sales during the holiday week which is a positive change as can be seen from the average sales being slightly higher than the weeks without holidays.
- It is also noted that there are more sales where the rate of unemployment is below the average unemployment rate and it can therefore be inferred that unemployment rate does not negatively impact sales.
